        <h3>Project Management</h3>
        <p class = "pmd">From deliberation and negotiation to delegation and resource allocation I have more than 10 years of taking ideas to new levels of exploration. Since being elected the first 7th grade President at my middle school, I've grown to manage multiple projects of varying complexity and importance. I've designed and managed renovation and astronomy projects and led Public Observing Nights for the Joseph R. Grundy Observatory, coordianated research projects with peers, drafted successful project proposals, successful budget proposals, written grants that were approved and even negotiated a higher budget. </p>

        <h3>Astrophotography and Stargazing</h3>
        <p class="clarkd">In 2016 I started as an avid stargazer and grew to be an Observatory Engineer within a year. The Joseph R. Grundy Observatory has provided me with many valuable experiences. With a 1884 11" Clark-Repsold Refractor and a 1967 Boller and Chivens 16" Reflector the universe is at our fingertipsðŸ“¸ðŸ”­</p>
